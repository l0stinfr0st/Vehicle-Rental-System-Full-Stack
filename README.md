    <h1>Vehicle Rental and Purchasing System</h1>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <div class="project-description">
        <p>This project is a <strong>Vehicle Rental and Purchasing System</strong> that allows users to rent or purchase vehicles through an intuitive and user-friendly web interface. The platform also enables users to sell their own vehicles, making it a comprehensive solution for vehicle transactions. The system is designed to handle various types of vehicles, with features to filter based on specific criteria such as make, model, and availability.</p>
        <p>The project was built using the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>SQL:</strong> To store and manage data related to vehicles, users, transactions, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>HTML & CSS:</strong> To structure and style the front-end of the application, ensuring a clean and responsive design.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> To add interactivity and dynamic features to the user interface, such as form validation, dynamic content loading, and more.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>What I've Learned So Far</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <p>Building this project has provided me with a wealth of experience in full-stack development. Here are some of the key takeaways:</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>1. Database Management</h3>
    <p>I gained a deeper understanding of SQL, including how to design efficient databases, write complex queries, and manage relationships between tables. This project reinforced the importance of data normalization and indexing to optimize performance.</p>

    <h3>2. Front-End Development</h3>
    <p>Working on the front-end, I improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned how to create responsive layouts, style components consistently, and add interactivity to web pages. I also became more familiar with JavaScript methods for manipulating the DOM and handling events.</p>

    <h3>3. Full-Stack Integration</h3>
    <p>Integrating the front-end with the back-end was a significant learning experience. I learned how to connect the front-end forms to the database using SQL queries, handle user input securely, and ensure data consistency across the application.</p>

    <h3>4. Problem-Solving</h3>
    <p>Throughout the development process, I encountered various challenges that required creative problem-solving. Whether it was optimizing the database, debugging JavaScript, or ensuring cross-browser compatibility, each problem provided an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.</p>

    <h3>5. Project Management</h3>
    <p>Managing this project from start to finish taught me valuable lessons in time management, planning, and documentation. I learned how to break down tasks into manageable pieces, prioritize features, and maintain clear documentation for future reference.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>Moving forward, I plan to continue improving the project by adding new features, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing user authentication and authorization.</li>
        <li>Enhancing the search functionality with more filters.</li>
        <li>Adding a reviews and ratings system for vehicles.</li>
        <li>Improving the overall UI/UX based on user feedback.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I’m excited to continue refining this project and applying what I’ve learned to future developments.</p>
